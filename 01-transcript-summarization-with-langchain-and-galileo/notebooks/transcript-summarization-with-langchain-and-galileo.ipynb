    "Having the information content loaded according to the transcription format - with the text split into audio blocks, or into paragraphs, we now want to group these small blocks into relevant topics - so we can summarize each topic individually. Here, we are using a very simple approach for that, by using a semantic embedding of each sentence (using an embedding model from Hugging Face Sentence Transformers), and identifying the \"breaks\" among chunks as the ones with higher semantic distance. Notice that this method can be parameterized, to inform the number of topics or the best method to identify the breaks."
