    "## Step 1: Downloading Notebooks and Extracting Code from Jupyter Notebooks\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In this step, we download Jupyter Notebook files (*.ipynb*) from a GitHub repository directly using the GitHub API, and extract both code and context from these notebooks. The code performs the following operations:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Downloading Notebooks from a GitHub Repository**:  \r\n",
    "  We begin by downloading only the Jupyter Notebooks from the desired GitHub repository using the function `download_and_extract_notebooks`.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "  - **Function** `download_and_extract_notebooks(repo_owner, repo_name, save_dir='./notebooks')`:  \r\n",
    "    - **Objective**: This function uses the GitHub API to download all `.ipynb` files from a given repository and saves them in a specified directory.\r\n",
    "    - **Process**:\r\n",
    "        - First, it checks if the target directory already exists. If it does, the directory is deleted to ensure a fresh copy of the notebooks.\r\n",
    "        - The function calls the GitHub API to list the contents of the repository and recursively navigates through subdirectories, downloading only the files that end with `.ipynb`.\r\n",
    "        - For each notebook downloaded, the function extracts the code and context (explained below).\r\n",
    "    - **Input**:\r\n",
    "        - **repo_owner**: The owner of the GitHub repository (e.g., `passarel`).\r\n",
    "        - **repo_name**: The name of the repository (e.g., `crawler_data_source`).\r\n",
    "        - **save_dir**: The directory where the notebooks will be saved (default is `./notebooks`).\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Extracting Code and Context From Notebooks**:  \r\n",
    "  After downloading the notebooks, the next step is to extract both the code and any markdown context from each notebook.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "  - **Function** `extract_code_and_context(notebook_path)`:  \r\n",
    "    - **Objective**: This function reads a notebook and extracts the code cells and any corresponding markdown context.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Process**:\r\n",
    "  - The notebook is opened using the `nbformat.read` function.\r\n",
    "  - The function iterates through each cell of the notebook:\r\n",
    "    - If the cell is of type markdown, it extracts the content of the markdown cell as context.\r\n",
    "    - If the cell is of type code, it creates a dictionary with the following fields:\r\n",
    "      - **ID**: A unique identifier for the code snippet, generated using `uuid.uuid4()`.\r\n",
    "      - **Embedding**: Initially set to None (embeddings will be generated later).\r\n",
    "      - **Code**: The code content of the cell.\r\n",
    "      - **Filename**: The name of the notebook file.\r\n",
    "      - **Context**: The markdown context associated with the code (if any).\r\n",
    "  - The extracted code and context are appended to a list.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Key Changes from the Original Approach:\r\n",
    "1. **No Cloning of the Entire Repository**:  \r\n",
    "   Instead of cloning the entire repository, we now directly interact with the GitHub API to download only the relevant `.ipynb` files, saving time and space.\r\n",
    "2. **Recursion into Subdirectories**:  \r\n",
    "   The code automatically handles subdirectories within the repository, ensuring that all notebooks, regardless of their location, are processed.\r\n",
    "3. **Cleaner Data Handling**:  \r\n",
    "   Each notebook is processed immediately after being downloaded, simplifying the workflow and ensuring that extracted data is directly available for further use.\r\n"

    "## Step 4: Store and Query Documents in ChromaDB 🔗🏦\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, we use ChromaDB, a vector database system, to store code snippets and their respective metadata. We also implement a function to retrieve documents based on queries. The code performs the following operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Connection and Collection Creation\n",
    "- **ChromaDB Client**: A ChromaDB client is initialized to interact with the database.\n",
    "- **Collection Creation or Retrieval**: The collection named \"my_collection\" is created (or retrieved, if it already exists) within the ChromaDB database. Collections are used to store documents and their corresponding embeddings.\n",
    "#### Inserting Documents\n",
    "- **Data Extraction**: The following fields are extracted from the DataFrame and converted into lists:\n",
    "   - **ids**: A list of unique identifiers for each document (code snippet).\n",
    "   - **documents**: A list of code snippets.\n",
    "   - **metadatas**: A list of metadata associated with each document, such as the filename and context.\n",
    "   - **embeddings_list**: A list of embedding vectors previously generated for the context of each code snippet.\n",
    "- **Inserting into ChromaDB**: The upsert method is used to insert or update the documents, ids, metadata, and embeddings in the created collection.\n",
    "#### Querying Documents\n",
    "- **Query**: After adding the documents to the collection, a query is performed. The code searches for documents related to the query text \"!pip install\", returning the 5 most relevant results.\n",
    "#### *retriever* **Function*\n",
    "- **Document Retrieval**: The retriever function is implemented to query the collection. It takes a query string, the collection, and the number of results to return (top_n) as parameters.\n",
    "  - **Query in ChromaDB**: The function executes a query in the collection using the provided string.\n",
    "  - **Creating Document Objects**: For each result returned, the function creates a Document instance containing the page content (code snippet) and its metadata.\n",
    "  - **Returning Documents**: The function returns a list of Document objects that contain the page content and metadata for easy retrieval and future analysis.\n"

    "## Step 5: Chain 🦜⛓️\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, we use a flow to automatically generate Python code based on a provided context and question. The code performs the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Function *format_docs(docs: List[Document]) -> str:*\n",
    "- **Purpose**: This function formats a list of documents docs into a single string by concatenating the content of each document (doc.page_content) with two line breaks (\\n\\n) between them. This ensures that the context used in code generation is organized and readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Language Model and Processing Chain:\n",
    "- **ChatOpenAI**: A language model from OpenAI is used to generate responses based on the provided prompt.\n",
    "- The **chain**processes data using the following components:\n",
    "  - **Context**: The context is formatted using the *format_docs* function, which calls the retriever function to fetch relevant context from the document base.\n",
    "  - **Question**: The question is passed directly through the chain to process the prompt.\n",
    "  - **Model**: The model generates the code based on the template and the provided data.\n",
    "  - **Output Parser**: The output is processed with StrOutputParser to ensure the return is a clean string.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Function *clean_and_print_code(result: str)*:\n",
    "- Purpose: This function takes the generated code string from the model and removes any formatting markers (e.g., ```python). After cleaning, the code is printed in a clean format, ready for execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interaction with Galileo:\n",
    "- The *promptquality* library is used to evaluate the quality of the generated prompts.\n",
    "- **Galileo Callback**: A custom callback is configured using the Galileo API Key, where the following evaluation scopes are set:\n",
    "   - **Context Adherence**: Evaluates whether the generated code aligns with the provided context.\n",
    "   - **Correctness**: Checks the factual accuracy of the generated code.\n",
    "   - **Prompt Perplexity**: Measures the complexity of the prompt, useful for evaluating its clarity.\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Chain Execution:\n",
    "- A set of inputs containing the query and the question is provided to run the chain. The system generates code based on questions like \"How can I use audio in RAG?\" and \"create code audio with RAG\" using the vector base.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Results Publishing:\n",
    "- The Galileo callback finalizes and publishes the results, recording the evaluation of each run of the code generation chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Function *create_new_code_cell_from_output(output)*:\n",
    " - Purpose: This function dynamically creates a new code cell in the Jupyter Notebook from the generated output. It handles different output formats such as strings or dictionaries (if the output contains JSON) and inserts the resulting code into the next code cell in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Processing the results: \n",
    "- After the chain execution, the function iterates over each generated result, attempts to parse it as JSON, and creates a new code cell in the notebook from the output. If the result is not JSON, it treats the output as a code string."
